# Hosts

The methods live in `.agents/skills/` (the open Agent Skills folder) and `AGENTS.md`; every coding agent reads the same files. This page is the only place for agent-specific commands. Everything else says "your agent".

First-class hosts get an installer route, gate hooks and a Safe reviewer preset. Other agents run the same methods and call the gate by hand.

## First-class hosts

| | Claude Code | Codex | Cursor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skills | `safe-engine` plugin (skills + hooks) | `~/.agents/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| Rules file | `AGENTS.md` (read when no `CLAUDE.md` exists; otherwise import it with `@AGENTS.md`) | `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Install | `fast_gate.py install --host claude` or [by hand](#claude-code) | `fast_gate.py install --host codex`, then trust it in `/hooks` | `fast_gate.py install --host cursor` |
| Invoke | `/safe-engine Build ...` | `$safe-engine Build ...` | `use safe-engine to build ...` |
| Question tool | `AskUserQuestion` (4 questions, 4 options each) | chat message | chat message |
| Gate hooks | plugin: `PreToolUse`, `Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionStart` | `~/.codex/hooks.json`: same events and JSON as Claude Code | `~/.cursor/hooks.json`: `preToolUse`, `stop`, `sessionStart` |
| Safe reviewer | `review --agent claude`: `claude -p`, Read/Grep/Glob only, `--json-schema` | `review --agent codex`: `codex exec --sandbox read-only --output-schema` | `review --agent cursor`: `agent -p --mode ask` |
| Model tiers (light / standard / deep) | `haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus` | host models | host models |

Python runs as `python`, `python3` or `py -3` (Windows). Claude Code hooks need a POSIX `sh` (Git Bash on Windows). Ticket checks use the GitHub CLI `gh` when the tracker is GitHub.

At a stop, Claude Code lists the session's background work (`background_tasks`). A running or pending `subagent` or `workflow` entry lets the stop pass: its result starts a new turn, whose stop the gate checks. Other entries (`shell`, `monitor`, `teammate` and the rest) and hosts without the list (Codex, Cursor) keep one block per stop. Limit: experimental observer agents (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_OBSERVER_AGENTS`) are listed as `subagent` but may never report back, so with them on, the last stop can pass without the reminder. The gate log records each passed stop as `hook.wait_stop`.

Reference commands are written for a POSIX shell: run them in Git Bash on Windows. PowerShell 5.1 breaks `{owner}/{repo}` placeholders and nested quotes in `--jq` filters. Stuck in PowerShell: replace the placeholders with real names and pass each jq filter in single quotes, inner double quotes escaped as `\"`.

Safe review picks an installed reviewer that did not build the candidate: `review --agent auto --builder <name>`. Builders are detected from `CLAUDECODE`, `CODEX_THREAD_ID` and `CURSOR_AGENT`; when the builder is unknown and several agents are installed, review asks for `--builder`. No agent CLI: hand `review-packet` to a fresh read-only subagent, then `review --report <file> --reviewer <id>`.

## Claude Code

The plugin brings `/safe-engine`, `/improve-factory` and the gate hooks. Its root is the repository's `skills/` folder. Pick one route:

- **Installer:** `python fast_gate.py install --host claude` adds the marketplace over HTTPS with auto-update and enables the plugin in `~/.claude/settings.json`, keeping a backup.
- **Settings by hand** (desktop app): add these keys to `~/.claude/settings.json`, then start a new session:

  ```json
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {"ai-software-factory": {"source": {"source": "git", "url": "https://github.com/seifsg/ai-software-factory.git"}, "autoUpdate": true}},
  "enabledPlugins": {"safe-engine@ai-software-factory": true}
  ```

- **Terminal:** `claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/seifsg/ai-software-factory.git`, then `claude plugin install safe-engine@ai-software-factory`. Use the HTTPS URL; the `owner/repo` shorthand tries SSH first.

## Other agents

| Agent | Skills | Gate | Safe reviewer |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Copilot | reads `.agents/skills`, `~/.agents/skills` | `.github/hooks/*.json`, PascalCase `PreToolUse` → `sh <launchers>/safe-engine/scripts/run-gate.sh copilot` (exit 2 denies) | review packet |
| Gemini CLI | reads `.agents/skills` | `BeforeTool` hook → `sh <launchers>/safe-engine/scripts/run-gate.sh gemini` (exit 2 denies) | review packet |
| OpenCode | reads `.agents/skills` | no declarative hooks: run `fast_gate.py` yourself | review packet |
| Anything else | point it at `.agents/skills/safe-engine/SKILL.md` | `fast_gate.py` by hand | review packet |

`fast_gate.py install --host other` copies the launchers into `~/.agents/skills` (or `--project <dir>`). Run hooks through `run-gate.sh`: it fails open when Python or the gate is missing. Unknown hosts get a generic reader: pre-tool events deny with exit code 2 and the reason on stderr; stop and prompt hooks need a first-class adapter.
